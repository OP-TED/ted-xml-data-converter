# Summary

This project is managed by the Publications Office of the European Union to assist organisations publishing procurement notices in their migration from TED XML to eForms. 

An organisation publishing procurement notices may wish to switch the production of notices in their system from the TED schemas to the eForms schema at a point in time. In this case, they will have published some initial notices (PIN, Contract Notice, etc.) for an ongoing Procedure using the TED schemas. They will want to publish following notices, continuing the Procedure, using the eForms schema. 

The TED XML Data Converter is designed to help with this process, by converting a notice published in the TED schemas, to a draft form of the same notice in eForms. The publisher can then correct and complete this notice, and use it as a basis for creating a following notice in eForms.

The repository contains the following folders:

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `xslt` | The xslt and data for the conversion |
| `development-notices` | Sample source TED XML files used for testing during development and their equivalent converted eForms XML files |
| `eforms-structure-files` | Sample files for the structure of eForms XML |
| `test-notices` | Sample notices in TED schema XML to be used for testing the converter |

The repository contains the following documentation files in Markdown format:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [README.md](README.md) | This file |
| [usage-information.md](usage-information.md) | General information on usage of this repository |
| [installation.md](installation.md) | Basic instructions on installation in a Unix environment |
| [development-methodology.md](development-methodology.md) | The technical approach to developing this conversion |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | The list of changes made since the last release |

Each folder also contains a README.md file listing the files in that folder and their purpose.


# How to use

Basic usage instructions for developers to run the code in their own system is available [here](usage-information.md).


## Versioning scheme

The versioning scheme which will be adopted for the TED XML Data Converter will be similar to that for the [eForms SDK](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/versioning.html).


## Feedback

Feedback on this converter is welcome. Please address questions, comments and bug reports using [Github Discussions](https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-xml-data-converter/discussions).


## Current status

All the standard TED XML forms using the R2.0.9 TED XML schema  (with the exceptions of F14 Corrigendum and F20 Modification) are now convertible:

* PIN (Prior information notice / Periodic indicative notice)
(F01, F04, F07, F08, F21 and F22)

* Contract Notice
(F02, F05, F12, F21, F22, F23 and F24)

* Contract Award Notice
(F03, F06, F13, F15, F21, F22, F23, F24 and F25)

### What's next?

Work on the Defense TED XML forms using the R2.0.8 TED XML schema has begun.
