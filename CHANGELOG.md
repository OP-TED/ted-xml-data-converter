# TED XML Data Converter 0.2.0 Release Notes

Below is a list of the major updates made to the Converter repository in this release. There was no substantial change to the XSLT code.

## Folder names changed

The four root folders were renamed to more clearly reflect their contents and purpose.

## Removal of unnecessary files

A number of files that were used during initial development, but are now no longer required, were removed.

## File names changed

The names of the Markdown files were changed to "kebab-case", to improve readability.

## Markdown documentation

The documentation in the various Markdown files was re-written to improve understanding of the different topics.

A README.md file was added to every main folder to describe the contents of the folder.

## Converted development test files

The test notices in folder development-notices/ted-xml were all converted using this version of the converter, updating the output files in folder development-notices/eforms-files.

## XSLT template location

Some XSLT templates used in more than one location were moved into a new XSLT file, common.xslt.
